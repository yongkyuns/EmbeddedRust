# Camera HAL

One camera contract and independently selectable providers. No default provider,
service construction, executor, clock wrapper or generated app manifest.

| Package | Support and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `api` | `no_std` camera/frame/format contract; depends only on the shared device-error values. |
| `native` | Linux/macOS/Windows packed Gray8/RGB565 file replay. Blocking bounded-size input loading at setup, bounded memory-copy polling, and exact owner-clock retry deadlines between frames. Not a physical camera driver. |
| `nuttx` | Existing NuttX read-device/ioctl adapter. C bridge uses configured target headers. Current execution qualification uses synthetic devices on sim/ESP32-S3 QEMU, not a physical camera. |
| `mock` | Explicit std-based scripted camera, including WASM test builds. Preserves deliberate staging corruption, failures and stop retries. Not a web hardware implementation. |

Each package records its support mode/platforms in Cargo metadata. Native and
NuttX providers reject unsupported targets. `target_os="none"` is admitted by
the NuttX provider only for existing core-only compilation/link fixtures, not
as a claim of bare-metal operation without NuttX.

The native rustcam profile acquires the camera through
`rustcam_camera::open(...)`. The build enables `rustcam-camera/native` on
the capability facade; app/rustcam has no direct provider dependency. Arguments, service wiring, timestamps and shutdown remain
unchanged. Replay now advertises `Camera::next_poll_at_ms()`, allowing the
app-owned execution loop to block until the next frame deadline instead of
polling every millisecond. Ordinary execution timekeeping continues to use
`std::time`.

## Dependency boundaries

`hal/common` owns only the pre-existing `DeviceError` values shared by camera,
storage and transport. It has no backend/runtime dependency. `hal/support/nuttx`
owns only the existing consumptive descriptor-close policy and bridge error
translation reused by camera, file storage and UDP. Adoption of a raw descriptor
is unsafe and requires unique ownership; close consumes the number even when
the driver reports an error. There is one implementation, not a copy per device.

The capability root crate `rustcam-camera` re-exports the portable contract
and owns provider selection. Provider crates depend only on the contract/support
they need; they never depend back on the facade.

## Target integration

Compile `nuttx/ffi/camera.c` and `../support/nuttx/ffi/nuttx_support.c` with the
configured NuttX headers, including both header directories. The former owns
format-query/open/read; shared support owns close. No timespec, file-descriptor
table, ioctl struct or native errno value crosses the scalar Rust/C boundary.
The existing sim/QEMU recipes build separate C objects and retain the close/error
fault hooks. Live-camera DMA/readiness and physical integration are unchanged
and still require their own qualification.

## Verification

`python tools/check-camera-isolation.py` uses a fresh target directory per build
and checks actual compiler-artifact package IDs, not just dependency declarations
or linker size. API builds contain only the API/common packages. Provider builds
include only the selected provider and its needed API/common/support. A native
camera-only executable runs, and native-on-WASM/NuttX-on-host must fail explicitly.
The existing end-to-end app/storage/UDP and NuttX fault/lifetime tests remain.

These checks do not establish a camera-only production firmware image, physical
camera timing, interrupt-driven readiness for the NuttX camera, or exclusion of
every NuttX C driver. The native replay timer path is event/deadline-driven, while
physical readiness remains a separate integration step.
