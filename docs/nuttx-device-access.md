# NuttX device access from Rust

**Status:** normative device-access design for NuttX HAL providers.

This document defines how a Rust HAL in Nxrs talks to a NuttX driver. It is
intentionally narrow: it does not introduce a second OS abstraction layer,
generic POSIX wrapper, device registry, or platform-wide HAL object.

The governing rule is:

> A hardware capability is implemented in its dedicated Rust HAL. Use qualified
> Rust `std` APIs directly for ordinary file/socket operations. Keep the small
> amount of NuttX-specific ABI glue required for device controls private to that
> HAL provider.

Portable applications and services see only typed capability APIs. They never
see device paths, file descriptors, `ioctl` request numbers, NuttX C structs,
or NuttX-specific error values.

## 1. Architecture

A typical physical NuttX capability has this shape:

~~~text
portable app/service
        |
        | typed Rust API
        v
hal/<capability>/
  api/                    provider-independent contract
  src/                    build-selected facade
  nuttx/
    src/                  NuttX implementation in Rust
    ffi/                  optional, minimal target-header glue only
        |
        +---- std::fs / std::io / std::net
        |         |
        |         v
        |      NuttX libc/VFS/socket interface
        |
        +---- private typed FFI, only when std cannot express the operation
                  |
                  v
               ioctl / target ABI operation
                  |
                  v
             NuttX VFS driver
                  |
                  v
          lower-half / hardware
~~~

The Rust NuttX provider is the implementation. The optional C file is not
another adapter architecture. It is only an ABI boundary for operations whose
constants, structures, or calling convention are defined by target NuttX
headers.

Examples:

~~~text
ImuService
  -> nxrs-imu
       -> hal/imu/nuttx Rust provider
            -> File::open("/dev/imu0")
            -> Read::read(...)
            -> private set_rate(fd, hz)
                 -> SENSORIOC_SETRATE ioctl

GnssService
  -> nxrs-gnss
       -> hal/gnss/nuttx Rust provider
            -> OpenOptions("/dev/ttyS1")
            -> private serial configuration
            -> Read::read(...)
            -> UBX/NMEA parsing in Rust
            -> typed GnssFix

application/service
  -> nxrs-led
       -> hal/led/nuttx Rust provider
            -> OpenOptions("/dev/userleds")
            -> set(index, on)
                 -> private NuttX USERLED ioctl
~~~

## 2. NuttX device nodes are normal descriptor-backed resources

NuttX drivers commonly register character, block, or other device endpoints in
the VFS, often under `/dev`. Opening such a path yields a normal NuttX file
descriptor whose operations are dispatched through the registered driver's file
operations.

Nxrs does not need to reproduce that VFS in Rust.

When the selected NuttX Rust `std` implementation has been qualified for the
required operation, the provider should use ordinary Rust APIs directly:

- `std::fs::File` / `OpenOptions` for descriptor-backed device nodes;
- `std::io::Read` and `Write` for driver `read`/`write` operations;
- `std::net` for qualified socket operations;
- Rust ownership for the lifetime of the opened resource.

Conceptually:

~~~text
OpenOptions::open("/dev/imu0")
        |
        v
Rust std
        |
        v
NuttX open()
        |
        v
VFS lookup
        |
        v
driver open()

File::read(...)
        |
        v
Rust std -> NuttX read() -> driver read()
~~~

This is the preferred path because it has no Nxrs-specific translation layer.

## 3. Typed Rust APIs, not OS APIs

The public HAL contract describes the hardware capability, not how NuttX
implements it.

Good:

~~~rust,ignore
pub trait Led {
    fn set(&mut self, index: u8, on: bool) -> Result<(), DeviceError>;
}

pub trait Imu {
    fn set_rate(&mut self, hz: u32) -> Result<(), DeviceError>;
    fn read_sample(&mut self) -> Result<Option<ImuSample>, DeviceError>;
}
~~~

Not part of a portable HAL API:

~~~rust,ignore
fn ioctl(&mut self, request: u32, argument: usize) -> ...;
fn raw_fd(&self) -> ...;
fn open_device(path: &str) -> ...;
~~~

An `ioctl` request is an implementation detail of one NuttX provider. A native
provider, browser provider, replay provider, or mock should be free to implement
the same typed Rust operation without pretending to have an `ioctl`.

## 4. How device-specific ioctl operations are implemented

Rust `std` intentionally does not provide a general device-specific `ioctl`
API. That does not justify a general-purpose Nxrs POSIX layer.

When a NuttX driver exposes a capability through `ioctl`, the corresponding
Rust HAL method translates the typed operation internally.

Preferred pattern:

~~~rust,ignore
impl Led for NuttxLed {
    fn set(&mut self, index: u8, on: bool) -> Result<(), DeviceError> {
        // Private implementation detail.
        ffi::userled_set(self.file.as_raw_fd(), index, on)
            .map_err(map_device_error)
    }
}
~~~

If the request constant and argument ABI are defined by NuttX headers, keep the
native layout on the NuttX side:

~~~c
int nxrs_userled_set(int fd, uint8_t index, bool on)
{
  struct userled_s request =
    {
      .ul_led = index,
      .ul_on  = on
    };

  return ioctl(fd, ULEDIOC_SETLED,
               (unsigned long)(uintptr_t)&request);
}
~~~

The helper should be compiled with the exact selected NuttX headers.

This boundary has three purposes only:

1. obtain request values from the real NuttX header configuration;
2. construct or consume native C structures with the target ABI;
3. enter the NuttX operation that Rust `std` does not expose.

It should not implement device policy.

## 5. Keep device behavior in Rust

The dedicated Rust HAL provider owns the meaningful device implementation:

- resource acquisition and Rust lifetime;
- capability configuration and validation;
- protocol parsing and serialization;
- conversion from raw device values to typed Nxrs data;
- bounded buffers owned by the capability;
- state and lifecycle;
- provider-level error mapping;
- readiness integration required by the service execution model.

The native helper must remain mechanical. Do not move the following into C merely
because the NuttX driver is written in C:

- UBX/NMEA parsing;
- IMU sample conversion or calibration;
- retry/state machines;
- packet framing owned by the capability;
- buffering policy;
- service event generation;
- application policy.

If reusable wire-protocol logic is independent of NuttX, it belongs in the Rust
HAL or a repository-owned Rust `driver/` module rather than in the native ABI
shim.

## 6. Boilerplate rule

A NuttX provider should normally consist of:

~~~text
hal/<capability>/nuttx/
  src/lib.rs       # real implementation
  ffi/...          # absent unless a target-specific operation requires it
~~~

Do not add wrappers for operations already available through a qualified Rust
standard-library path.

In particular, do not create capability-local C wrappers merely to rename:

~~~text
open()
read()
write()
socket()
send()
recv()
close()
~~~

when the provider can use the corresponding qualified Rust `std` facility
directly.

Similarly, `hal/support/nuttx` must not grow into a generic I/O or POSIX
abstraction package. Shared NuttX support is justified only for genuinely
cross-capability ABI/lifetime behavior that cannot live more naturally in one
provider.

The goal is for a new NuttX hardware capability to require mostly Rust code and,
in the common case, either no C glue or a few tiny target-header helpers.

## 7. Device paths and platform configuration

A portable service must not know that a GNSS receiver is `/dev/ttyS1`, that an
IMU is `/dev/imu0`, or which bus/address/IRQ backs either device.

Those facts belong below the portable boundary:

~~~text
product platform / NuttX board configuration
        |
        v
selected capability provider
        |
        v
provider-local configuration
        |
        v
NuttX device node
~~~

The exact mechanism can vary by capability. Do not create one giant portable
configuration enum solely to represent provider-specific resource descriptions.

## 8. Relationship to NuttX upper/lower-half drivers

Nxrs should reuse NuttX's driver model rather than mirror it.

NuttX remains responsible for low-level hardware integration such as:

- board and bus setup;
- IRQ/DMA interaction;
- lower-half driver operation;
- kernel-side synchronization and buffering;
- registration of the VFS device;
- implementation of `open/read/write/ioctl/poll` semantics.

The Nxrs Rust HAL begins at the user-facing driver contract exposed by NuttX.

~~~text
Rust capability semantics
        |
        v
NuttX provider in hal/<capability>/nuttx
        |
        v
descriptor operations + minimal private controls
        |
        v
NuttX upper-half / file_operations
        |
        v
NuttX lower-half
        |
        v
hardware
~~~

Nxrs therefore does not need another C "upper half" above the NuttX upper half.

## 9. Readiness and event delivery

This device-access design does not prescribe a second execution framework.

A HAL/provider may need blocking I/O, descriptor readiness, an IRQ-originated
notification, or a dedicated acquisition loop. Whatever mechanism is chosen,
the NuttX-specific wait/readiness details remain inside the capability/provider
boundary and integrate with the service communication model documented
elsewhere.

Do not expose raw descriptor readiness as application policy solely because the
underlying NuttX device uses a file descriptor.

## 10. ABI qualification

Using Rust `std` does not imply that every libc/NuttX interface is automatically
qualified on every Nxrs target.

Each production path must be qualified against the selected Rust/NuttX
configuration. In particular:

- use direct `std` functionality where that exact path has compatible target
  ABI and behavior;
- keep C-native structures behind target-header glue when the Rust binding/layout
  is not established;
- do not manually duplicate NuttX structure layouts or request-number macros in
  portable Rust;
- qualify resource lifetime, error behavior, and any required readiness path.

This is a reason to keep the native boundary small, not a reason to wrap all
ordinary I/O.

## 11. Current repository migration direction

The desired direction is already demonstrated by the NuttX transport provider,
which uses `std::net::UdpSocket` directly and contains no socket wrapper layer.

Some older camera/storage compatibility providers still route ordinary
`open/read/write/close` operations through C bridges. Those paths were useful
for earlier `no_std` and ABI qualification work, but they are not the template
for new physical HALs.

As each corresponding Rust `std` path is qualified, simplify those providers:

~~~text
before
Rust HAL -> C open/read/write/close wrapper -> NuttX

target
Rust HAL -> Rust std -> NuttX

and only where required
Rust HAL typed method -> tiny private ioctl/ABI helper -> NuttX
~~~

Existing special close/error qualification must be preserved where its stronger
lifecycle semantics are part of a capability's requirements; migration must not
silently weaken an already tested failure contract.

## 12. Design invariants

The following are architectural invariants:

- Applications and services consume typed Rust capability APIs.
- A concrete hardware resource is implemented in its dedicated Rust HAL provider.
- NuttX device paths, descriptors and request numbers stay below that boundary.
- Qualified `std` APIs are used directly instead of being rewrapped.
- Device-specific native ABI glue is private and minimal.
- C glue contains no protocol or product logic.
- No generic Nxrs POSIX/device framework is introduced.
- Unselected capability providers and their exclusive glue are absent from the
  production dependency graph.
- Adding a new physical device should primarily add Rust code to its capability,
  not a parallel C adapter stack.
