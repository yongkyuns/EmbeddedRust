# NuttX heap and stack qualification

This qualification complements the host Rust `GlobalAlloc` measurements in
`docs/memory-qualification.md`. It uses NuttX's own procfs data on the
Cortex-M33/MPS2 qualification image; it does not reinterpret Rust allocator
counters as operating-system memory.

## What is measured

The MPS2 profile explicitly requires `CONFIG_FS_PROCFS=y` and
`CONFIG_STACK_COLORATION=y`, and keeps process/meminfo procfs entries enabled.

For both `std-demo` and `ao-stress`, the QEMU harness reads
`/proc/meminfo`:

1. before the first measured application lifecycle,
2. after one warm-up lifecycle,
3. after each of five checked lifecycles.

NuttX's meminfo implementation reports total, used, free, historical maximum
used, largest free block, used-block count and free-block count for each
ordinary registered heap. Reading meminfo also asks NuttX to reclaim delayed
frees before reporting the heap values.

The first application lifecycle is reported separately because one-time runtime
initialization may legitimately change the baseline. After warm-up, every
checked lifecycle must return `used` and `free` exactly to the warm baseline.
The largest free block may stay equal or improve, but may not shrink. This is a
strict repeated-lifecycle fragmentation/reclamation check; there is no arbitrary
byte tolerance.

## Active-object stack high-water

`ao-stress --stack-report` uses the unchanged workload and an observation-only
completion barrier. Each producer, worker and collector finishes its real
handler loop, then remains alive at the barrier. While every owner is paused,
the main task reads:

- `/proc/<pid>/status` for the NuttX task/thread name;
- `/proc/<pid>/stack` for `StackSize` and `StackUsed`.

NuttX stack coloration retains each owner's lifetime high-water use, so the
measurement happens after the workload without needing a sampling thread in the
hot path. The observer requires exactly the configured owner inventory and
rejects missing/duplicate owners, missing coloration data, zero sizes, or
`StackUsed > StackSize`.

Every detail is emitted as `NUTTX_STACK_RESULT` JSON followed by an independently
checked `NUTTX_STACK_SUMMARY`. The external harness validates all four scenarios
and five repeated runs, then records the worst observed owner usage.

The barrier exists only when `run_observed` is selected. Normal
`stress::run` uses no completion-ready channel/gate and the standard CLI path
is still executed twice in the same boot after the diagnostic cycles.

## Run

The existing firmware qualification invokes this automatically:

```sh
cargo firmware --app std-demo --platform mps2-an521-mock
cargo firmware --app ao-stress --platform mps2-an521-mock

python3 tests/host/run-std-apps-nuttx.py \
  --qemu "$(command -v qemu-system-arm)" \
  --app ao-stress \
  --image target/firmware/ao-stress/mps2-an521-mock/nuttx/nuttx \
  --log target/firmware/ao-stress/mps2-an521-mock/console.log
```

Parser and false-success controls run independently on the host:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/host -p test_nuttx_memory.py -v
```

## Interpretation limits

These values characterize the exact NuttX configuration and QEMU-executed
Cortex-M33 image. QEMU timing is not physical-MCU timing. Stack coloration
measures high-water bytes touched, not a proof that every future call path fits.
The heap lifecycle check can detect retained bytes or degradation of the largest
free block across the exercised cycles, but it is not a proof that arbitrary
future allocation patterns cannot fragment the heap.

The procfs reads themselves have implementation cost. Heap snapshots are taken
only after application termination and use the same command each time; stack
reads occur while owners are intentionally paused after their measured work.
None of these diagnostic observations is used as a throughput or latency
benchmark.

Primary pinned NuttX implementation references:

- `fs/procfs/fs_procfsmeminfo.c` at the nxrs-pinned NuttX commit;
- `fs/procfs/fs_procfsproc.c` for `StackSize` / `StackUsed`;
- the nxrs MPS2 platform profile for coloration/procfs qualification.
